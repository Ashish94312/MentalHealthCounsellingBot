# Mistral Fine-tuning Setup Instructions

## 🎯 Overview

You now have a complete setup for fine-tuning Mistral on your mental health counseling dataset. The setup includes both GPU and CPU-optimized versions.

## 📁 Files Created

### Core Scripts
- `finetune_mistral.py` - Main fine-tuning script (GPU optimized)
- `finetune_mistral_cpu.py` - CPU-optimized fine-tuning script
- `prepare_mistral_data.py` - Data preparation for Mistral format
- `prepare_data_simple.py` - Simple data preparation for smaller models
- `test_mistral_model.py` - Model testing script

### Configuration Files
- `requirements_mistral.txt` - Python dependencies
- `MISTRAL_FINETUNING_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive guide
- `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - This file

## 🚀 Quick Start (CPU Version - Recommended for your setup)

Since you're on macOS without CUDA, use the CPU-optimized version:

### 1. Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
source mistral_env/bin/activate
```

### 2. Prepare Data (Simple Format)
```bash
python prepare_data_simple.py
```

### 3. Start Fine-tuning (CPU)
```bash
python finetune_mistral_cpu.py
```

**Note**: CPU training will take several hours but will work on your system.

## 🎮 GPU Version (If you have access to a GPU)

### 1. Prepare Data (Mistral Format)
```bash
python prepare_mistral_data.py
```

### 2. Start Fine-tuning (GPU)
```bash
python finetune_mistral.py
```

## 📊 Your Dataset

- **Training samples**: 640 conversations
- **Validation samples**: 160 conversations
- **Format**: Mental health counseling conversations
- **Quality**: High-quality, professionally reviewed responses

## 🔧 Key Features

### CPU Version (`finetune_mistral_cpu.py`)
- Uses DialoGPT-medium (smaller model)
- Optimized for CPU training
- Lower memory requirements
- Longer training time but more accessible

### GPU Version (`finetune_mistral.py`)
- Uses Mistral-7B-Instruct
- QLoRA (4-bit quantization)
- Faster training with GPU
- Higher memory requirements

## 💡 Recommendations

### For Your Current Setup (macOS, no CUDA):
1. Use the CPU version with DialoGPT-medium
2. Start with a small subset of data for testing
3. Consider using cloud GPU services for full training

### For Production:
1. Use the GPU version with Mistral-7B
2. Train on the full dataset
3. Implement proper safety measures

## 🧪 Testing

After training, test your model:
```bash
python test_mistral_model.py
```

## 📈 Expected Results

The fine-tuned model should:
- Provide empathetic responses to mental health questions
- Maintain professional counseling tone
- Include appropriate disclaimers
- Suggest professional help when needed

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Memory**: CPU version needs ~8GB RAM, GPU version needs 16GB+ RAM
2. **Time**: CPU training takes 4-8 hours, GPU training takes 1-2 hours
3. **Safety**: Always include disclaimers about professional help
4. **Ethics**: Use responsibly and follow mental health guidelines

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Out of Memory**: Use smaller batch sizes or CPU version
2. **Slow Training**: Normal for CPU, consider cloud GPU
3. **Model Loading Errors**: Check internet connection and disk space

### Getting Help:
- Check the comprehensive guide: `MISTRAL_FINETUNING_GUIDE.md`
- Review error messages carefully
- Start with small datasets for testing

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Test the setup** with a small dataset first
2. **Run full training** when ready
3. **Evaluate results** using the test script
4. **Deploy responsibly** with proper safety measures

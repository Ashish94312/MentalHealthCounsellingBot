If you are feeling upset or if you are feeling another emotion : insert worried, ambivalent, scared, angry, insecure, confused that is likely reasonable if the relationship has undergone some breaks in trust followed by distance (seperation).

Every time my boyfriend tries to kiss, hug, or touch me I almost always push him away. I'm on birth control and it has killed my sex drive. \r\n\r\n I love him so much.  Why do I do this?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I sympathize with you! It is actually quite common for one partner to have a higher sex drive than the other, and can lead to discord in the relationship. The good news is, there are ways to deal with this.You may have already answered your question. There are many medications that can alter one's sex drive. If your birth control pills are the cause of this, talk to your doctor about switching to a different brand. You may even consider alternate methods for birth control, such as condoms.However, there are some other things to ask yourself. First, you used the term \"affection\" but then talked about sex. They're not the same thing. There are different kinds of intimacy, and many different ways to show love for someone. A book you might find useful is \"The Five Love Languages\".Defining what \"affection\" means to you, and to him, and discovering all the ways you both can show this towards each other, may help lessen some of your anxiety over this.Humans are hard-wired to need appropriate physical touch. In fact, studies have shown that newborns/premies who can receive skin-on-skin contact with their parent can recover faster than babies who don't receive this touch. It's called Kangaroo Care.\u00a0Children who have grown up in neglectful environments where they're not hugged and kissed and shown appropriate physical contact can often be unable to show this to their partners and children when they're adults. One question to ask yourself is, were you having intimacy issues before starting the medication? If so, there may be other, deeper issues at play here.For someone who has received the wrong kind of sexual/physical touch (sexual abuse, physical beatings) it can be difficult to allow someone to be physically close to you. A therapist could help you work through this.Sometimes, a person may lose their sexual feelings for their partner due to issues in the relationship. Once those issues are resolved, the sex drive comes back. Examine your relationship and see if either of you are unhappy, if you've been arguing a lot, or if there are any problems in your relationship that need to be addressed.Finally, look for the other ways that the two of you may be intimate in a non-sexual way. You may be doing things for each other that you don't even realize, and noticing these will help you appreciate it more. Take the stress off of the sexual gratification and focus on showing your love in other ways. Some people like to give gifts, do the other person's chores, or do other things they think the person will appreciate.If, after all of this, you still have a discrepancy with one of you having a higher sex drive, there are many articles online that offer advice for couples dealing with this situation that you may find useful. It is a very common issue for a lot of couples."}]}

This is a bit more difficult and can be very nerve-wracking. \u00a0It may be beneficial to take this with you to supervision, as well. \u00a0It's important to understand why you feel the need to end or terminate with the client, as well. Do you feel that they would be better suited for another therapist, have they achieved their goals or is it something else?In regular, open-ended sessions, I try to make a point of checking in with the clients fairly frequently. In these check-ins, I use the time to ask the client how they feel about the sessions and if there is anything they wish to focus on more astutely. \u00a0I also ask if they have any immediate goals that they would like to prioritize. \u00a0In goal-oriented sessions, I check in more frequently to ensure that both the client and I remain focused and, should they wish to shift their focus, that they recognize it is part of my responsibilities to make sure we move back to the desired goal.\u00a0Often, especially in longer term therapeutic relationships, we as clinicians can see that the client has reached their goal, however they are apprehensive about ending therapy. \u00a0This is actually a great place to go with them; why would they feel unable to handle issues in their external or internal environment without you? Often, having this open discussion can increase empowerment and mastery. That said, it could also highlight other issues which the client may have been apprehensive about going into within therapy and now, as the relationship seems to be ending, feels more confident in bringing these up.\u00a0In the case where the relationship is a toxic one, terminating with a client may be the best option for both of you. It's a difficult conversation, but recall that part of the role of the therapist is to model that these discomforts can be managed.\u00a0I hope that this brief response can assist you going forward!"}]}

When they do talk about bisexuality, they say things like \u201cthey'll do anything\u201d or things that make me very uncomfortable because I am bisexual. I don't know if I am ready to come out to them."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\nHello, and thank you for your question. Being bisexual can be particularly\r\ndifficult because it is often misunderstood, even by people who are \u201csupposed\u201d\r\nto be part of your own community, such as lesbians and gays. It happens so\r\noften that there is actually a term for it \u2013\u00a0\r\nbi-erasure. This is simply something that happens when people deny that\r\nbisexuality is a real thing, or discriminate against bisexuals due to beliefs\r\nlike your parents seem to have. \nThe unfortunate truth is that you can never\r\nbe sure of how you parents may take this kind of information. It sounds\r\npromising that they are accepting of other sexual orientations, and it may\r\nsimply be that your parents lack education about bisexuality. With accurate\r\ninformation, they may come around, but there is no way to be sure. \nSome of my colleagues have already given you good information. Here are some more\u00a0things that you can consider\r\nand questions you can ask yourself before making the decision to tell them:\n\u00a0\n1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 If they don\u2019t respond the way you want them to, have you developed a support\r\nsystem to support you through it? This is very important. The truth is that all\r\nthe friends in the world won\u2019t prevent pain or sadness if your parents don\u2019t\r\nrespond as you hope, but they will at least be there to remind you that you ARE\r\nokay as you are. And that is critical for you to remember. \n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 There is great information on the internet about bisexuality that you can\r\noffer your parents if you think it would be helpful. It may be important for\r\nthem to know the kind of damage that is being done to bisexual adults and young\r\npeople because of the myths surrounding bisexuality. Here is an article from\r\nGLAAD about bi-erasure: http://www.glaad.org/bisexual/bierasure\n\u00a0\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Coming out to people is obviously deeply personal and should only take\r\nplace when you are ready. Sometimes people get pressured from friends, media,\r\nand even people they are romantically involved with to come out before they are\r\nready. It really is up to you. If you are feeling pressure from others, don\u2019t\r\nfeel bad about setting your boundaries and telling them that you will come out\r\non your own time. Intimate partners should respect you enough to understand\r\nthis. \n\u00a0\n4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Something else to think about is your own comfort in being bisexual. Just\r\nbecause someone is LGBTQ doesn\u2019t mean that they necessarily want to be. Many\r\npeople struggle with this. Having\r\nyour own doubts or insecurities may also play a part in how comfortable you are\r\nin telling your parents. So, perhaps do some self-exploration about your\r\nfeelings toward yourself. \n\u00a0\nSometimes people take friends with them\r\nwhen they decide to come out to their parents. This is something you may want\r\nto consider. The important thing to remember is that you are okay. Really. If\r\nyour parents don\u2019t respond well, that doesn\u2019t mean that they never will. Some\r\nstart off upset, but then work their way through it. \nBest of luck to you. \nRobin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC \n"}]}

There's a great book \"The Five Love Languages\" by Gary Chapman. He explains that there are five main ways to give and receive love, but we don't necessarily all speak the same \"love language\" as our partner. You might feel that by going out to work and earn money, you're being loving, but if your partner's main love language is quality time, you're not hitting that bulls eye because you're not home! The five languages are words, quality time, acts of service, gifts and touch. I recommend couples grab this book, sit down and figure out what their love languages are, and then...slowly...you start to ask for the kind of love you want, and you start to speak your partner's language a bit better. You may never be fluent, but you can get better. The most important part is to understand each other better and to know that there's nothing wrong with either of you, you're just speaking different languages. You can help your boyfriend to get really specific about how he wants to be loved. I bet he just needs you to \"speak his language\". \u00a0:)"}]}

That's great that you have added this in your routine. Have you also considered altering your diet? Certain foods are linked with poor sleep. For example, alcohol, caffeine, nicotine and high fat content foods do not bode well with quality sleep, especially right before bed time.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, warm milk and foods high in carbohydrates have actually shown to positively impact sleep.Additionally, at bed time it's important to keep your room dim, cool and without distractions (i.e. TV, IPad, Phone). Stick to a sleep routine and avoid any activities close to bed time that demand a lot of attention and energy.As far as your nightmares, there could be many causes contributing to them. Certain foods (many of the ones mentioned) or medications could be the culprit. Doing a bit of research into the ones you are consuming may help you eliminate the offender.\u00a0You may also benefit from talk therapy with a qualified therapist to discuss any underlying issues you are experiencing. Oftentimes, depression and anxiety can manifest themselves during sleep, causing nightmares.\u00a0Finally, Yoga has shown to be very beneficial for quality sleep. There are many instructional videos available that can introduce you to the practice if you'd rather not join a class right away.\u00a0Best of luck to you and I sincerely hope you are able to catch up on some well deserved Z's!"}]}

The awesome (and challenging) thing about it is that when you work on the internal aspects that may need attention, you can learn to find a sense of centeredness that comes with practicing mindfulness and asking yourself who you really are and want to be. Through this deeper work, you can actually be in the midst of chaos and still feel that calm and peace within yourself. If you look for support in this journey from a counselor or therapist, I'd recommend looking for someone offering Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) or Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MCBT).

How can I handle it all and feel less stressed out?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are many causes for feeling stressed out. Between a demanding job, family responsibilities, and everything else that can come up, stress becomes more and more part of our everyday life. One of the best ways to combat the toxic effects of stress on our bodies, social lives, and overall well being is to engage in self-care. But not the self-care that most people think of like vacations or massages. The best self-care is the kind that helps you live the life that you already have rather than escape it. You see, the reason why vacations and massages don't work long term in reducing stress is that they allow you to escape from what is causing the stress without truly fixing it so you just return to what already stressed you out. So, instead you need to find ways to help live with the stressors that you already have. They can be things like creating a more manageable schedule, introducing healthy eating or exercising, financial planning, and even learning a few simple relaxation skills. The key to combatting stress is to make small but consistent changes to your life so that it becomes more manageable and more enjoyable."}]}

As a married stepmother, I've been there, and as a therapist, I can tell you that the boundaries and communication skills you have in your relationships need to be healthy for you to feel healthy. Finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful - being able to hear from others that you aren't alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load, and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations. Another option is to find a counselor or therapist who has experience working with step/blended family dynamics - because even if you're not officially married, those dynamics come into play whenever there are kids from another relationship involved. You may even consider couples counseling so that both of you can learn to talk about your relationship needs and concerns in a way that will encourage connection and strengthen your sense of partnership."}]}
